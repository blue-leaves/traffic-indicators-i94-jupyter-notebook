# Description of the project

This is an analysis that aims to investigate which factors determine heavy traffic on I-94, an Interstate Highway that connects Minneapolis to Saint Paul (in the state of Minnesota, USA).

I use pandas to load the dataset, and thanks to data visualization tools available by the matplotlib.pyplot library - histograms, bar charts, donut charts - I proceed to illustrate my findings.

While the dataset is overall tidy, I also dedicate a portion of the analysis to fix an issue present in it that allows me to better explore the data.
